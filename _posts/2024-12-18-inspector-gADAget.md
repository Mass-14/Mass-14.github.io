# Introduction

{: .box-mission}
Movies often reflect the culture and society of a certain time and represent topics people are interested in. Your mission is to explore how the themes and topics of movies have evolved over time, correlating them with trends observed in newspapers.  
<br>
Use the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, which includes data from over 42000 movies.  
<br>
Your goal is to determine how societal issues are present in movies and how this presence evolves in comparison to the same topics in news articles.  
<br>
You have to examine their potential correlations and how they may appear shifted in time.

Right chief you can count on us!  
We will detect important topics **GOGO GADGET Topic Modeling** in both the CMU dataset and a news article dataset from the New York Times. From that, we will be able to compare the representation of these topics over time.

## Datasets

Lets decribe the datasets our chief gave us to accomplish our difficult mission.
The first dataset is the CMU Movies Summary Corpus dataset. The movies metadata seemed to be of great interest for our task. It contains 81’741 movies up to 2012. We now have movies names, their dates of release, their countries of production and their genres in our toolkit. We have also access to the plot summaries of 42’306 movies, perfect to detect relevant topics !  
The second one as our disposition is a dataset from the New York times obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tumanovalexander/nyt-articles-data. The dataset is big and covers the year, title and and excerpt of news from 1920-2020. It certainly offers a valuable resource to analyze the presence of themes over the years.
